	<h2>Welcome!</h2>

	<p>My name is Joe Molohon. I am a student of the Scientific & Technical Communication graduate certificate program at University of Minnesota. With luck, I will also be pursuing my Master's of Science in the same field, at the same university.</p>

	<!---<h2>About</h2>

	<p>Outside of work, my favorite hobbies are reading and writing. Outside these primary interests, I like running, working out, praciting jiu jitsu, watching movies, cooking, and gaming. I also enjoy the outdoors, primarily as experienced through hiking, biking, and kayaking.</p>

	<h2>Background</h2>

	<p><strong>Education</strong></p>
	<p>I received my Bachelor of Arts in English from the University of St. Thomas. In addition to the major, I obtained minors in Film Studies and Communication &amp; Journalism.</p>

	<p><strong>Work</strong></p>
	<p>Currently, I work at 3M Fall Protection as a technical writer. At 3M Fall Protection, I write user manuals, coordinate translation and printing of said manuals, and I manage a repository of over 1,000 files. It has been a very rewarding job so far, with plenty of challenges to address each day.</p>

	<h2>Research Interests</h2>

	<p>My primary research interests are process management and learning methodologies. I enjoy working with complex systems of information and I am particularly fascinated by how information is acquired. I have always been a pretty decent learner, although I do not believe that this is something written into my genes. I believe that a strong learner is grounded in good learning habits and that, with the right mindset, anyone can live as an intelligent person.</p>
